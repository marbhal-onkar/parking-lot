# Design a parking lot

> A parking lot or car park is a dedicated cleared area that is intended for parking vehicles. In most countries where cars are a major mode of transportation, parking lots are a feature of every city and suburban area. Shopping malls, sports stadiums, megachurches, and similar venues often feature parking lots over large areas

> Parking lot is an open area designated for parking cars. We will design a parking lot where a certain number of cars can be parked for a certain amount of time. The parking lot can have multiple floors where each floor carries multiple slots. Each slot can have a single vehicle parked in it.

## Requirements gathering

What are some questions you would ask to gather requirements?
```
```

## Requirements
What will be 10 requirements of the system, according to you?
Do not worry about the correctness of the requirements, just write down whatever comes to your mind.
Your job is not to generate the requirements, but get better at understanding problem statements and anticipating the functionalities your application might need.
```
```

## Use case diagrams

Are the requirements clear enough to define use cases?
If not, try to think of the actors and their interactions with the system.

### Actors
What would be the actors in this system?
```
```

### Use cases

What would be the use cases i.e. the interactions between the actors and the system?

#### Actor 1

Name of the actor - ` `

Use cases:
```
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
```
#### Actor 2

Name of the actor - ` `
Use cases:
```
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
```

#### Actor 3

Name of the actor - ` `
Use cases:
```
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
```
Add more actors and their use cases as needed.

**Create a use case diagram for the system.**

```
```

## API design

What will be some APIs that you would design for this system?

Look at the use cases and try to design APIs for each of them.

You can simply write the APIs in the following format:
`API name` - `HTTP method` - `URL` - `?Request body` - `?Response body`

You could also use a tool like [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) to design the APIs or follow [this](https://github.com/jamescooke/restapidocs) repository for a simple way to use Markdown to structure your API documentation.

### APIs for Actor 1

#### APIs Category 1
```markdown
* `API name` - `HTTP method` - `URL` - `?Request body` - `?Response body`
```

### APIs for Actor 2

#### APIs Category 1
```markdown
* `API name` - `HTTP method` - `URL` - `?Request body` - `?Response body`
```

### APIs for Actor 3

#### APIs Category 1
```markdown
* `API name` - `HTTP method` - `URL` - `?Request body` - `?Response body`
```

## Class diagram

What will be the major classes and their attributes?

```
    Class name
        - Attribute 1
        - Attribute 2
        ...
```

List down the cardinalities of the relationships between the classes.
```
```

Draw the class diagram.
```
```
